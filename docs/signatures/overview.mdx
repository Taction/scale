description: Learn how Scale Signatures work and how they're used in Scale Functions.
---

Signatures are one of the core concepts behind Scale Functions.

They are used to define the inputs and outputs of a function using a declarative syntax we call the **Scale Signature DSL**,
and once they are parsed by our compiler we are able to generated cross-language type safety.

We use the [Polyglot](https://github.com/loopholelabs/polyglot-go) library under the hood to facilitate efficient
serialization and deserialization of structured data between host and guest languages and to cross the WASM boundary.

We also publish and support a number of **Official** Scale Signatures for common use cases:

| Signature                  | Description                                                        | Supported Languages              | Available Adapters                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Latest Version |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [HTTP](/signatures/http)   | HTTP Signature meant to be used for HTTP handlers and middleware.  | Go, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript | [net/http](/languages/golang/adapters/net-http), [FastHTTP](/languages/golang/adapters/fasthttp), [ExpressJS](/languages/javascript-typescript/adapters/expressjs), [NextJS](/languages/javascript-typescript/adapters/nextjs) | 0.3.6          |

Official are maintained by the Scale Functions team and come with [Adapters](/languages/golang/adapters/net-http) which
allow them to be used seamlessly from popular Frameworks and Libraries.

<Note>
    We are working on a way to allow users to publish their own Signatures! If you are interested in this feature,
    please join the `#scale` channel in our [Discord](https://loopholelabs/discord) and let us know!\
